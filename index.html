The randomization included evolutions such that a Torchic would not necessarily evolve into a Combusken.</p><p> The rules were known to be: A Pokemon's new evolution would match at least one of the types of its natural evolution, and that the the new evolution would have a BST within 20% of the natural evolution. The pages produced by this build will show what these rules allow a Pokémon species to evolve into or from.</p><p> There are three known points of inaccuracy. First, the randomizer will not allow a Pokémon to evolve into itself, but this code was never changed to account for that. Second, the Randomizer, if it tries and fails to find an evolution within the allowed parameters, will increase the upper range of allowed BSTs. So, even though Flygon's BST is 30% more than Dugtrio's BST, enough luck allows a Diglet to evolve into a Flygon. Lastly, BSTs were randomized as well, although this was not figured out until someone noticed that Mega Rayquaza's Special Attack was significantly lower than Rayquaza's Special Attack, and that Mega Rayquaza's HP was higher than Rayquaza's HP. If no one noticed before then, the difference couldn't have been that much, but it would explain how Chansey was allowed to evolve into Wigglytuff.</p><p/><p/></div><h2>Games List</h2><ul class="gamesList"><li data-game="alpha-sapphire"><a href="alpha-sapphire/index.html">alpha-sapphire</a></li><li data-game="platinum"><a href="platinum/index.html">platinum</a></li><li data-game="white2"><a href="white2/index.html">white2</a></li></ul></main></body></html>
